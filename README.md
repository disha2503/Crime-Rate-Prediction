PROBLEM DEFINITION
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the crime rate in a given
geographical area based on historical crime data, socio-economic indicators, and other relevant
factors. The model should be able to provide insights into the factors that contribute to crime and
help law enforcement agencies and policymakers make data-driven decisions to reduce crime and
improve public safety

OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
1. The main objective of the project is to predict the crime rate and analyze the crime rate to be
happened in future. Based on this information the official can take charge and try to reduce
the crime rate.
2. The system will look at how to convert crime information into a regression problem, so that
it will help detectives in solving crimes.
3. Crime prediction is based on available information to extract crime patterns. Using regression
techniques, frequency of occurring crime can be predicted based on territorial distribution of
existing data.

IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation plays the most important part in any project report. Implementation is used to
execute, or practice of a plan, a method, design, model, specification, idea standard or policy for
doing something. The implementation phase is when the end user interacts with the product.
Our model mainly works on the input given by the user such as district, year and rate of
particular crime. It predicts the output as overall rate for the crime of past and future by analyzing
previous years data and present data. The first phase in implementation consists of collection and
pre-processing of data. The collection of data is done from manually which consists of various
district, the years and the rate of particular crime to predict the rate of the particular crime for the
past and future.
